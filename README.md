# AUC-Data-Relationship-
Relationship between AUC, size of data and number of features\

1. Create a plot that shows performance (AUC) of random forest models with 10, 20, 30, … 200 trees, and on training and testing data (build all 20 models to complete the assignment). Use highUtilizationPredictionV2wco dataset.\

2. Rank input attributes in the data. Create a plot that shows dependency between number of selected top attributes  and AUC of learned model. You can use any attribute selection method and two different classification methods of your choice. Use highUtilizationPredictionV2wco dataset. For all questions below, make sure sufficient detail are provided in areas where learning curves are "interesting".\

3. Create a learning curve for the data to check AUC (y axis) based on size of data (x axis).\

4. Create more learning curves (on one plot) for different numbers of input attributes. Do it for random forest, logistic regression, and naïve Bayes.\           

a. Use random selection of input attributes (repeat 10 times and compare) \          

b. Use ranking of attributes from question 2\

5. Create 3D plot with learning curves as follows: x-axis number of attributes, y-axis size of training data, z-axis AUC of obtained models
